## Notes

**Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.**

This project was very exciting for me because this is the first iOS application I have created. That being said, there were instances where I was confused 
on how to approach a feature. One of the main challenges I faced was learning how to use defaults to save/load user input. While the idea was not too 
difficult to grasp, I was a bit confused with the proper syntax for loading in the data I saved. Another challenge I faced came with making sure the functions 
I created were properly connected from the storyboard to ViewController.swift. This became a challenge when trying to have the total amount change everytime the 
bill amount was updated. However, I was able to resolve my issue by stepping away from my work for a bit, and coming back with fresh eyes. Overall this project was 
very helpful for me to gain an introduction into iOS mobile development.
